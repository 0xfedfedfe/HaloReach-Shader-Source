# HaloReach-Shader-Source

Extracted from the July 7th 2011 tags build of Halo Reach.

The extensions were chosen based on a heuristic that if a file contained ".hlsl" case-insensitively within the first two lines, it was given a .hlsl extension.

The decorators/ folder breaks this rule and has its file extensions explicitly set to .hlsl.
