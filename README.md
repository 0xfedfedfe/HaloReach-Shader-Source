# HaloReach-Shader-Source

Extracted from the July 19th 2011 tags build of Halo Reach using [Mandrill](https://github.com/ChimpsAtSea/Blam-Creation-Suite#engineering-overview).

The extensions were chosen based on a heuristic that if a file contained `.hlsl` case-insensitively within the first two lines, it was given a .hlsl extension.

Some files have had their extension fixed up manually.

This is not complete; .h files were not processed into .hlsl_include tags so they can't be recovered.
